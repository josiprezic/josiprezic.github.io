### NMAP

>nmap -p21,139,22,445,3632 -sV -sC -T4 -Pn 10.10.10.3 -oA 10.10.10.3

![nmap](/assets/img/htb/lame/nmap.png)

### FTP

`ftp` allows for anonymous login, nothing was found.

We now that `vsftpd 2.3.4` has a backdoor available, however this exploit did not work.

### SMB

Searching for samba exploits via searchsploit:

We have a username map script for the exact version of smb through metasploit

## Exploit

This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!
